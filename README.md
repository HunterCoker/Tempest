Tempest

Setting:
- starts in a village next to a mountain
- the rest of the game follows on the mountain of which a tempest has formed at the peak

Conflict:
- an unknown entity at the peak of the mountain has been brewing a violent storm (a tempest) projected to
	consume the entire planet in only a matter of days
- the player encounters various worlds along the mountain that, when completed to a certain degree, unlock
	gateways to higher points of the mountain, eventually opening up a path to the top; each world has
	their own unique theme and playstyle

Objective:
- The player must platform to the top of the mountain in the hopes of putting a stop to whatever is causing
	the tempest, saving the planet

Outcome:
- Once the player reaches the top of the mountain, they are greeted with an enemy that has the power to
	channel large storms and maliciously control the environment
- It'll be a simple bossfight where the player must destroy 3 weak points of the mountain while platforming
	through enemy attacks. Once all the weak points are struck, the mountain collapses in its entirety, 
	halting the tempest and saving the planet
